(1)PaccMannRL: De novo generation of hit-like anticancer molecules from transcriptomic data via reinforcement learning

This paper bridges systems biology and drug design by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for de novo molecular generation based on gene expression profiles.ðŸ’Š Paccman RL proposes a hybrid Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture that learns to generate molecules tailored to cancer-specific transcriptomic profiles. The molecule generation is guided by a powerful drug sensitivity prediction model, PaccMann, which serves as the reward function in the RL setup. Even without explicitly training on known anticancer drugs, our model inherently biases generation toward compounds with high predicted efficacy against specific cell lines or cancer types. Additionally, molecule generation can be further refined using constraints such as:

âœ… Toxicity minimization

âœ… Drug-likeness

âœ… Synthesizability

âœ… Solubility

(2)Toward Explainable Anticancer Compound Sensitivity Prediction via Multimodal Attention-Based Convolutional Encoders.ðŸ§ 

Drug discovery is one of the biggest challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, consuming nearly 19% of global R&D spending. Notably, anticancer compounds dominate the drug development pipeline, making up over 34% of all drugs under development. This paper addresses these bottlenecks by leveraging deep learning, reinforcement learning, and transcriptomic data to generate novel compounds with high predicted efficacy against cancer cell linesâ€”accelerating the path toward precision oncology. Paccmann is reward system which proves to be State-of-the art model for drug sensitivity prediction.ðŸ§¬
